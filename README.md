# Personal
A repository of random but useful Python programs

Adventure Game:
  - A text-based Adventure Game
  - It's actually more complex than most text-based games and is easily the best program in this repository
  
Complex Calculator:
  - An object-oriented Calculator
  
Conjugator
  - A Spanish verb conjugator
  - Very helpful for Spanish class homework

Encrypter
  - Encrypts any string comprised of any characters
  - Uses "metahexahashing", or hex(hash(hex(hash(string)))) as an oversecure way to protect data
  - The decrypter tries to create a mega-dictionary and fails
    - Don't use the decrypter unless you have, like, a quantum computer

FLLpredictions
  - For First Lego League Robotics Teams
  - Used to calculate the percent chance that your FLL team has of moving on in the competition

MeanAtomicMassCalc
  - Useful for Physics/Chemistry homework
  - Calculates the mean atomic mass of an element

PIDControl
  - A PID Controller (Or really a PI controller, since the D doesn't work) implemented in Python
  - For theory and thought only; Real PID Controllers are coded in Java or RobotC

Pokemon naming device
  - Enter your human name and you'll get a pokemon name!
  - Uses an algorithm found on Reddit
    - Yes, someone actually made a full-blown algorithm to determine what their name would be as a pokemon
    - The world is full of nerds
    
Staircase
  - Creates a staircase ASCII art
  - One of the first programs I ever made that I deemed worthy enough for GitHub

VidBot
  - Will actually open the number of tabs on the computer in a separate window
 Â - Doesn't generate views except by making you actually watch the video 'x' number of times

To_Be_Gone
  - Language arts teachers hate to be verbs
  - Enter a block of text as a string, and the program will replace any to be verbs
  - The output text will not be 100% grammatically or structurally correct
